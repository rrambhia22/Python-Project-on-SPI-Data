# Python-Project-on-SPI-Data


1.	Data Extraction:

  a.	Dataset: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037996/Statistical-Performance-Indicators

  b.	Data Description: Statistical Performance Indicators are developed to monitor the statistical performance of the countries and the parameters involved in this dataset are country, date, SPI index for data use, SPI index for data services and data products and overall SPI index score. The reason mentioned about why this was developed is because there were challenges in making decisions for having high quality data. To keep a check on the performance and to avoid the challenges, this dataset would be used. Every country depending on the region has its overall SPI score based on the year. The data has 50 indicators and has data for 174 countries.

2.	Data Visualization:

Data visualization was performed on the dataset to further analyze the dimensions of data.
The first graph represented the SPI Data Analysis for parameters date and data services score. Here, it was found that the score increased in the year from 2016. Similar analysis was done on data products score and was found that the score had an increase in the year 2017 and was none in the year 2004.
The next analysis was done on the overall score attribute based on the region. Here it was visualized that Europe & Central Asia had the highest overall score and South Asia region had the lowest score. 
The final two visualizations performed were on the data services score and data products score based on the region and in this analysis, it was found that East Asia & Pacific region had a score of 100 with respect to the data services score and Latin America & Caribbean region with respect to the data products score.

3.	Descriptive Analysis:

The conclusions drawn from the descriptive analysis was that the minimum value of data services score was 0 and maximum value of 100. Similarly, minimum value of data products score was 0 and maximum was 90.94. For the overall SPI score, the minimum value was 0 and maximum was 90.29. 
The mean value was computed for different attributes which are as follows:
SPI Overall score: 12.07
SPI Data Services score: 11.87
SPI Data Products score: 47.94
The questions answered through this analysis could be which region with respect to the country in the year has the highest overall score and which had the lowest which would help in analyzing the performance of the quality of data. Similar analysis could be done with respect to data services score and data products score. This analysis would further help me in improving the statistical performance of the countries and also in decision-making for data quality.

4.	Predictive Analysis:

For the predictive analysis, linear regression model was created to predict the SPI overall score for the particular year. The accuracy obtained was 54.58. The confusion matrix and classification report were printed to further analyze the data and predict the particular attribute. This analysis answers the questions that in which year the overall SPI score index was high or low and the prediction is made which would help in future analysis to improve the countryâ€™s performance in data quality.
